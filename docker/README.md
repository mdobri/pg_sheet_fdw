# Postgres Docker Image for PG_Sheet
This Docker Image compiles and tests the Sheet Reader Foreign Data Wrapper PG_Sheet.

Use the Makefile for Image building.
Alternatively, the script ../compile_In_Docker.sh also builds the Image, starts a container and runs tests on it. The container keeps running afterward.
